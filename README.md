# Brithday-remainder
Overview of Project:
1 )Users can add birthday data to the program and can search for particular data.
2 )Simple user interface with 3 prompts for searching, inserting data and exiting the program.

Logic:
1. We will give choice to user for what operation they want to perform.
2. Like add a birthday, look a birthday.
3. And for each look query we will first check if we have data and if we have
    we will look in our dictionary.
4. If found we will print.
5. Similarly for adding, we will add data as key value pair.
